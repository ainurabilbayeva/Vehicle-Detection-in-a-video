# Vehicle-Detection-in-a-video

The scope of this project is to process the video from a highway, detect and count the number of cars passing using cv2.

In the notebook, cars_detection_and_count.ipynb you can find code for detecting and counting the cars. Note to change filename to the path where you have video.

The cars.xml is the trained classifier, which describes some features of some object we want to detect (cars). See https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d28/tutorial_cascade_classifier.html

The ENCE688V_Project II_AinurAbilbayeva is the pdf file, which descibes a brief writeup of this project. The surveillance.m4v is the sample video, which I used to process on the code. The results described in the project refer to this video.
